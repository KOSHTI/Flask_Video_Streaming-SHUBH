## Flask_Video_Streaming [SHUBH]

## Descripition:
Flask is a Python web framework. Video streaming means transmitting videos in real-time. In Flask, you can stream videos by breaking them into small parts and sending them continuously to the user's web browser.

To do this, you create a route in Flask that handles video streaming requests. Inside this route, you use libraries like OpenCV or FFmpeg to read video frames and send them as a continuous response to the user.

Users can access the video streaming route through a URL to watch the video in real-time. Flask allows you to customize authentication, video encoding, and other features as needed.

In addition to video streaming, Flask also allows users to click photos while watching the video. By integrating with the browser's capabilities, you can capture screenshots or frames from the streaming video. This feature can be useful for capturing specific moments or sharing images from the video stream.

Overall, Flask provides a user-friendly way to stream videos over the internet and enables viewers to click photos while watching the stream. It is a powerful tool for building video streaming applications with additional functionalities.
